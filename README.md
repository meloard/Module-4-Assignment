# Module-4-Assignment

AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

# Javascript Quiz App

## Description

This objective was to complete a timed quiz, that deducts time when a user inputs an incorrect answer, and then allows a user to save their score after completing the quiz. The quiz subject matter is focused on basic Javascript principles. This was my first walkthrough dealing with more than one HTML page, and subsequently more than one .js file. It taught me a lot about how to properly iterate through an array (which we used to build our questions/answers) and then figuring out how to let a user save their scores using local storage.
